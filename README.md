Never was working with a Newtonsoft.Json library. 
Becouse of lack time I deside to work with type - object. 
Maybe the library can return result as needed - clear string. 
In this case no needs to replace chars to clear topping name.

I my case obviously it is no needs to use the library. The same can be done with List of string.
